- nilEvent
  >> priority implementation = lockout
  
the new nilEvent priority mechanism can actually force an application
into a never "exitable" loop. nilEvents can be processed; howver, no 
other events can make it through to the system. there needs to be some
mechanism implemented that will prevent nilEvents from taking over.

- dynamic input areas
  >> Tapwave Zodiac, Tungsten T3, Garmin iQue 3600/3600a
  
implementation issues with the dynamic input area support. using PINS
on these devices causes a software reset = un-explainable? the Garmin
iQue devices dont have sufficient dynamic memory for 320x448 - hence, 
by default, these devices will only run in legacy mode (320x320).
